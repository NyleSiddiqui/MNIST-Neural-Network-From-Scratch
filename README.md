# MNIST-Neural-Network-From-Scratch
A Neural Network built from scratch, made to identify handwritten digits in the MNIST database. Based off the book "Neural Networks from Scratch" by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela. I followed along with the book and developed my own network, from scratch (no external machine learning libraries) to read in handwritten digits from the MNIST database, and learn to correctly identify them. There are multiple optimizers to choose from (Stochastic Gradient Descent, AdaGrad, Adam, etc.) and different activation functions as well. The different parts of the network are split up into different classes for organizational sake. main.py is the only class you need to run the network. Further improvements are on the way, like implementing weight regularization, momentum, and other network-improving concept.
